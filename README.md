You can imagine the meeting with your friend, not for the sake of dealing with some problem or aim. Just play and talk about some empty things that don't matter. But those moments matter a lot.

And actually, about the game: imagine you play chess , but someone cuts the board to 6x6 and steals all the pieces except for the knights, The king is resting on the bath floor. You have 10 seconds on the clock, every move matters. You and your opponent decide that you are allowed to move simultaneously. But knights are difficult. Try to catch your opponent's knight before he catches you, but don't fall of the board!

About controls: You play on the same computer. Player one is controlled by WASD, Player two is controller by arrows. Press two keys to move, the first key should indicate the main direction (long straight of the knight move), and the second key should indicate the secondary direction (short straight of the knight move). How keys correspond to the board axis is shown in the hint below the board. Player one is on the left and plays white, Player two is on the right and plays black.
